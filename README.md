# Autism Spectrum Disorder Prediction Web Application

A modern web application for autism spectrum disorder prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning, featuring a beautiful glassmorphism design.

## 🚀 Features

- **Advanced CNN Analysis**: Uses deep learning models for autism spectrum disorder detection
- **Object Detection**: Automatically detects human features in uploaded images
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models for accurate predictions
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern, beautiful UI with glass-like effects
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Real-time Analysis**: Live processing with visual feedback

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with Vite
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Glassmorphism design
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow.js for browser-based inference
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6
- **File Handling**: React Dropzone

## 📦 Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd autism-spectrum-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**

## 🎨 Design Features

### Glassmorphism Elements

- **Glass Cards**: Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur effects
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Animated gradient backgrounds
- **Floating Particles**: Interactive particle system
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and hover effects
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design approach

### Color Scheme

- Primary: `#667eea` (Blue)
- Secondary: `#764ba2` (Purple)
- Accent: `#f093fb` (Pink)
- Glass: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` with blur effects

## 🧠 AI/ML Features

### Object Detection

- **Human Feature Detection**: Identifies human faces and features
- **Non-human Object Filtering**: Prevents analysis of inappropriate images
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics

### CNN Analysis

- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Analyzes emotional expressions
- **Eye Contact Patterns**: Detects gaze patterns and eye contact
- **Social Interaction Cues**: Identifies social behavior indicators
- **Behavioral Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes movement and posture

### Prediction Results

- **Probability Scoring**: Autism spectrum vs neurotypical probabilities
- **Risk Assessment**: Low, moderate, or high risk levels
- **Feature Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of individual features
- **Recommendations**: Actionable next steps based on results

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive and optimized for:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured experience with large cards
- **Tablet**: Optimized layout with adjusted spacing
- **Mobile**: Touch-friendly interface with stacked layout

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Loading

The application supports multiple model loading strategies:

- **TensorFlow Hub**: Pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub
- **Local Models**: Custom trained models
- **Fallback Detection**: Simple image analysis when models fail

### Customization

- **Colors**: Modify CSS variables in `src/index.css`
- **Animations**: Adjust timing and effects in CSS
- **Layout**: Modify Bootstrap classes and custom CSS
